## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VEPARALADEVENDRA/Your-Smartest-Scientific-Companion..git
cd calculator-project
open index.html


## 🧠 How It Works
The UI accepts two numbers via input fields.

When a user clicks a button (e.g., +, -), JavaScript reads the values and applies the selected operation.

The result is displayed in a styled output box on the right.

| Input 1 | Input 2 | Operation | Output |
| ------- | ------- | --------- | ------ |
| 10      | 5       | +         | 15     |
| 12      | 4       | /         | 3      |
| 7       | 0       | %         | 7      |
